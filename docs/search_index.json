DO NOT USE OR CITE Section 1 Survey Sampling This pages document data sources and methods used to generate detailed spatially-referenced characteristics of farm households interviewed as part of AgResults 2015-2017 porgram evaluation in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda. All statistics are derived using the geospatial locations of surveyed respondents. However these locations are sometimes missing or invalid. In the case of missing coordinates we generate spatial statistics at the centroid of the matching administrative unit (the lowest level unit that may be mapped with any confidence, i.e. LGA for Nigeria, county for Kenya, and district for Uganda). Note that another approach would be to derive average statistics over the entire administrative unit, however this approach is more resource-intensive. 1.1 Nigeria 2,065 households are sampled in Nigeria. There are 81 households missing coordinates and 414 possibly invalid locations.

In the majority of instances the distance is negligeable (under 10km) and this might not affect any of the spatial estimates. In a few instances the errors are troublesome (over 40km). For documentation purposes households with problematic locations are highlighted on the map below. Fig. 1.1: Households with Invalid GPS Locations, Nigeria 1.2 Kenya In Kenya data was collected over 2 rounds with some attrition, and household locations do not necessarily match across rounds. We use a general approach to impute missing and/or conflicting coordinates: if both GPS locations seem valid, we use the middle point if only 1 of the 2 locations is valid, we use that one if no location is valid (both fall outside of a recorded administrative unit), we use this unit centroid. 5,235 households are sampled in Kenya. There are 470 households missing coordinates and nrow(ken.odd) possibly invalid locations. Details in the table below.

Information is produced daily, and can work across large spatial scales. The IrriSAT methodology uses satellite images to determine a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each field, from which the plant canopy size can be determined and a specific crop coefficient (Kc) can be estimated. IrriSAT provides a web API to batch retrieve daily NDVI and Kc at specified locations. irrisat.services.data.cropgrowth() 2.1.2.3 CRU TS 4.00 http://browse.ceda.ac.uk/browse/badc/cru/data/cru_ts/cru_ts_4.00/ 2.1.2.4 ERA-Interim (Jan 1979–present) ERA-Interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979, continuously updated in real time.

Below is an example for Nigeria. Red areas are within a 5 km distance buffer to a mapped road. NGA network For reference there is an R geoknife and Python PyGDP library to access a subset of USGS rasters off CIDA’s THREDDS server, but currently that repository does not incorporate FEWSNET data.↩ NOAA CPC RFE Rainfall Estimates (version 2.0) for data over Africa – daily precipitation is obtained by merging GTS gauge observations and 3 kinds of satellite estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Resolution is 0.1 degree. Units are in millimeters (mm). The RFE algorithm is based on the PingPing Xie method currently being employed as an operational product at the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center in association with USAID/FEWS-NET. Maps of daily, dekadal, and monthly rainfall estimates, as well as documentation on the RFE algorithm methodology may be found at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/fews/rfe.shtml.↩ Potential Evapotranspiration – daily global PET is calculated from climate parameter data that is extracted from Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) analysis fields. The GDAS data is generated every 6 hours by NOAA. The GDAS fields used as input to the PET calculation include air temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation (long wave, short wave, outgoing and incoming). PET is computed for each 6 hour period and then summed to obtain daily totals. A day is defined as beginning at 00 hours GMT. The daily PET is calculated on a spatial basis using the Penman-Monteith equation (the formulation of Shuttleworth (1992) for reference crop evaporation is used). These equations were standardized in accordance with the FAO publication 56 for the 6-hourly calculations (Allen et al, 1998). The daily PET values are scaled up by a factor of 100 to preserve the precision to .01 mm. The PET data have a 1 deg. ground resolution and are global in spatial extent.↩ SSEBop Evapotranspiration Products (version 4) – ET is the combination of transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from soil. Actual ET (ETa) is produced using the operational SSEBop model (Senay et al., 2012) for the period 2000 to present. This model combines ET fractions generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal imagery, acquired every 8 days, with reference ET using a thermal index approach. The unique feature of the SSEBop parameterization is that it uses pre-defined, seasonally dynamic, boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the “hot/dry” and “cold/wet” reference points. The actual ET data unit is millimeters (mm). The anomalies are the ratio of ETa and the corresponding median ETa, expressed as a percent value.↩ eMODIS NDVI C6 – distributed by USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. Satellite-derived vegetation products generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). These products, known as eMODIS, respond to operational land monitoring applications requiring near-real time Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for comparison against historical records. Real-time and historical NDVI products are composited in 10-day intervals every 5 days on a Geographic mapping grid.↩ NOAA Climate Prediction Center Africa Rainfall Climatology (version 2) – this data is a result of a project to create a satellite-estimated precipitation climatology over the Africa domain. This climatology has been created to compliment the daily operational rainfall estimate product (RFE) in order to generate anomaly fields over Africa over various timescales. In contrast to the RFE, where inputs include SSMI, AMSUB, half-hourly GPI, and GTS data, ARC uses only 3-hourly GPI and GTS data, exclusively This is due to the absence of microwave-derived estimates over a long-term historical record, and the large amount of data which makes up the operational half-hourly GPI input. As such, the ARC algorithm itself has been slightly modified in order to maintain a homogeneous and stable climate data record. GTS rain gauge data used in both static and daily-updating climatology products is of the same source, though inputs used to create GPI estimates differ slightly in source. For creation of the climatological GPI, 3-hourly Meteosat data was obtained directly from Eumetsat’s archived data group, while daily-updating products use 3-hourly data pulled from NOAA’s Meteosat data feed. Data resolution and specifications of the ARC dataset are identical to that of the RFE.↩ NOAA CPC RFE Rainfall Estimates (version 2.0) for data over Africa – daily precipitation is obtained by merging GTS gauge observations and 3 kinds of satellite estimates (GPI,SSM/I and AMSU). Resolution is 0.1 degree. Units are in millimeters (mm). The RFE algorithm is based on the PingPing Xie method currently being employed as an operational product at the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center in association with USAID/FEWS-NET.
